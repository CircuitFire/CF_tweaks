re-balance-turrets=Re-balance turrets
fix-ammo-range=Fix ammo range
thermal-laser-artillery=Thermal laser artillery
add-liquid-tib-recipes=Add liquid tiberium recipes
add-tib-resistance=Add tiberium resistances
add-tib-thrower=Add liquid tiberium turret
re-balance-rampant-eggs=Re-balance rampant eggs
re-balance-rampant-crystals=Re-balance rampant crystals
fix-248k-mu-trains=Fix 248k trains for mu 
re-balance-248k-krastorio-bots=Re-balance 248k bots for krastorio
ion-tib-det=Ion-cannon tiberium detination
ion-tib-node-det=Ion-cannon tiberium node detination

[mod-setting-description]
re-balance-turrets=Remove damage bonus for turrets from tech and adds a 50% bonus.
fix-ammo-range=Fix ammo range when using krastorio and hero turrets.
thermal-laser-artillery=Add flames to laser artillery.
add-liquid-tib-recipes=Adds recipes for liquid tiberium so it can be used like molten tiberium.
add-tib-resistance=Adds tiberium damage resistances to walls.
add-tib-thrower=Adds a liquid tiberium turret.
re-balance-rampant-eggs=Removes rampant Arachnids eggs resistances and adds a fire vulnerability. So they don't waste as much ammo.
re-balance-rampant-crystals=Removes resistances from the rampant target dummy crystals. They make laser artillery kind of useless normally.
fix-248k-mu-trains=Changes the internal name of the 248k mod trains so that they work with Multiple Unit Train Control. Pick up and re-place any existing trains to change them. Don't remove this mod because the changed trains will probably disappear.
re-balance-248k-krastorio-bots=Increases the cargo size of 248k bots a bit so they are better than the default bots with krastorio.
ion-tib-det=All tiberium ore cought in the blast of an Ion-cannon will explode with the same force as a tiberium rocket.
ion-tib-node-det=All tiberium nodes cought in the blast of an Ion-cannon will explode with the same force as a tiberium nuke. (only works if Ion-cannon tiberium detination is also enabled)
